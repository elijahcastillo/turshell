<!-- 3. Once installed, you can start writing and executing Turshell code right away! -->


## Language Basics

### Data Types


Primary data types in Turshell:
- **int**: Integer numbers.
- **string**: Textual data.
- **bool**: Boolean values (true/false).
- **float**: 3.1415
- **array**: store data of the same type

### Variable Declaration
Strongly typed variables in Turshell:
```turshell
int year = 2024;
string message = "Turshell rocks!";
bool isValid = true;
float pi = 3.1415;
array<int> arr = [1,2,3];
```

### Control Flow
Turshell includes familiar control structures:
```turshell
// If Statements
int temp = 22;
if(temp > 20){
  print("Warm weather")
}

// While Loops
int count = 0;
while(count < 3){
  print("Count is " + count)
  count = count + 1;
}
```

### Functions
Defining and invoking functions:
```turshell
func add(int a, int b) int {
  return a + b;
}

int result = add(5, 3);
print("Result: " + result)
```

### Structs and Methods
Object-oriented features in Turshell:
```turshell
struct Vehicle {
  string model;
  int year;
};

impl Vehicle -> displayInfo(Vehicle self) void {
  print(self.model + " made in " + self.year)
}

Vehicle myCar = {model: "TurboX", year: 2023};
myCar.displayInfo();
```

### Advanced Features
Turshell supports recursion, enhanced control flow, struct operations, native functions, and string handling, enabling complex and efficient programming solutions.
