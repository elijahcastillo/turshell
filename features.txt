- variable names with numbers
- for loop
- float and int multiplcation / addition



- nativeAppend with structs
 - Add functions to structs  impl Struct -> age() int {

                             }
 - pass in error messages to validate array and struct functons for better errors
 - Fix line numbers for errors due to remove whitespace in lexer


 - If you update the data inside of the runtimve valuje like setElement in the array, then yes any references to that array will also be changed, but if you reassign a new arrayliteral to that variable that used to hold the old array then the old array will not be updated

 - bassically total reassignment wont change orignial, but sub-assignemtn will
 - have copy() native function

 -Log feature for debugging
 - TurshellLog(std::string, enum type)
 - in main call Log.setTypes(INFO | Address | ...)

 Total Assigment
 ===============
 int a = 3;
 int b = a;
 b = 5;
 print(a) // Still 3
 print(b) // 5

 Sub-Assignment
 ==============
 array<int> a = [1,2,3];
 array<int> b = a;

 //Sub assigment
 b[1] = 8;
 print(a) // [1,8,3]
 print(b) // [1,8,3]


 //Total assigment with arrays
 b = [4,5,6]
 print(a) // Still [1,2,3]
 print(b) // [4,5,6]
